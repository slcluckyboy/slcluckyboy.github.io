I am currently pursuing an integrated Master’s and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Sogang University](https://www.sogang.ac.kr/en/home) where I was advised by Professor Saejoon Kim. I received an BS in Computer Science from [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home) at ERICA Campus.

My research interests include machine learning, quantitative finance, and more.
